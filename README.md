# Flight Delay Big Data Analysis

Comparative big-data analysis of the **2024 Flight Delay Dataset** using **Spark SQL**, **Spark Core**, and **Hive**, with a focus on data preparation, analytical correctness, execution efficiency, and scalability benchmarking.

This repository is developed for the **Big Data Course — Second Project** at **Roma Tre University**.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze a large real-world flight dataset using multiple big-data technologies and compare their behavior in terms of:

- Expressiveness
- Ease of implementation
- Execution time
- Scalability
- Shuffle and aggregation cost
- Reproducibility

The project uses the **2024 Flight Delay Dataset**, which contains more than 7 million flight records and includes information about flights, delays, cancellations, diversions, airlines, airports, and operational attributes.

The final output of the project will include:

- Cleaned and prepared datasets
- Analytical jobs implemented with multiple technologies
- Benchmark results for different input sizes
- Tables and charts comparing execution times
- A final PDF report
- Reproducible execution scripts

## Analyses Implemented

This project focuses on at least two analytical jobs from the assignment specification.

### 1. Delay Report by Airport and Month

For each departure airport, month, and departure-delay range, the job computes:

- Number of flights
- Average departure delay
- Average arrival delay
- Delay range:
  - Low delay: less than 15 minutes
  - Medium delay: between 15 and 60 minutes
  - High delay: more than 60 minutes
- Most frequent cancellation or delay causes, when available

### 2. Airline-Airport Ranking

For each pair of departure airport and airline, the job computes:

- Number of flights operated by the airline at the airport
- Average departure delay
- Average arrival delay
- Cancellation rate
- Difference between the airline average departure delay and the airport average departure delay
- Airline ranking at the airport based on average departure delay

## Dataset

The project uses the **2024 Flight Delay Dataset** from Kaggle.

The original dataset is not included in this repository because of its size.

Download the dataset manually from Kaggle and place the CSV file under:

```text
data/raw/
```

Expected local structure:

```text
data/
└── raw/
    └── flight_data_2024.csv
```

The exact filename can be configured in:

```text
config/local.yaml
```

---

## Data Preparation

Before running the analytical jobs, the raw dataset must be cleaned and normalized.

The preparation step is responsible for:

- Loading the raw CSV file
- Validating the schema
- Selecting relevant columns
- Normalizing column names
- Casting numeric and date fields
- Handling missing values
- Keeping cancelled flights for cancellation-rate analysis
- Writing the cleaned dataset in Parquet format

Prepared data output:

```text
data/prepared/flights_2024_clean.parquet
```

Run locally:

```bash
make prepare
```

Or directly:

```bash
bash scripts/run_prepare_local.sh
```

---

## Generated Input Sizes

For benchmarking and scalability analysis, the project generates reproducible
datasets of different sizes from the canonical prepared Parquet input.

Default generated datasets:

```text
data/generated/flights_100k.parquet
data/generated/flights_500k.parquet
data/generated/flights_1m.parquet
data/generated/flights_3m.parquet
```

The full-size local input is referenced directly from
`data/prepared/flights_2024_clean.parquet` instead of being copied. The optional
large replicated datasets are:

```text
data/generated/flights_14m.parquet
data/generated/flights_28m.parquet
```

Smaller datasets are created with a seeded deterministic hash-limit method and
exact row limits. Larger datasets are created through controlled replication:
full repetitions of the prepared dataset plus a deterministic hash-limited
remainder. Forced generation may print Spark `WindowExec` warnings because exact
deterministic selection uses a global ordering step; validated manifest counts
are the success signal.

Run:

```bash
make generate-sizes
```

Replace existing generated inputs or opt into the larger replicated datasets:

```bash
make generate-sizes FORCE=1
make generate-sizes GENERATE_LARGE=1 FORCE=1
```

Generation writes `data/generated/input_size_manifest.json` with the validated
row count, generation method, seed, source path, and reuse status for every
benchmark input. Benchmark runners should use this manifest as the source of
truth and skip optional entries such as `14m` and `28m` unless they are present
with successful validation.

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/flight-delay-big-data-analysis.git
cd flight-delay-big-data-analysis
```

### 2. Create a Python environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Place the dataset

Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it under:

```text
data/raw/
```

### 5. Prepare the dataset

```bash
make prepare
```

---

## Running the Jobs

### Run Spark SQL jobs

```bash
make run-spark-sql
```

Or on Windows:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe src\spark_sql\run_spark_sql.py
```

On Windows, Spark SQL output writing requires Hadoop `winutils.exe` configured
through `HADOOP_HOME` or `hadoop.home.dir`.

### Run Spark Core jobs

```bash
make run-spark-core
```

On Windows, `make run-spark-core` uses the Docker Compose Spark Core service so
PySpark RDD worker execution runs in Linux. On Linux, WSL, or macOS, it runs the
native Spark Core runner directly.

Run the native path directly for diagnostics with:

```powershell
make run-spark-core-native
```

Validate Spark Core outputs against the Spark SQL reference with:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\validate_spark_core_outputs.py
```

Run only the Spark Core RDD worker smoke check with:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe src\spark_core\run_spark_core.py --smoke-rdd
```

Spark Core writes its small aggregate CSV outputs locally, so it does not require
Hadoop `winutils.exe` for output writing. If the native Windows RDD smoke check
fails with `Python worker exited unexpectedly`, use the stable command:

```powershell
make run-spark-core
```

That command mounts this repository, runs the same Spark Core runner with Python
3.12 and Java 17 in Docker, and writes the same `outputs/spark_core/` files. The
explicit Docker target remains available as `make run-spark-core-docker`.

### Run Hive jobs

```bash
make run-hive
```

This starts the Docker Compose Hive stack with HiveServer2, a standalone
metastore, and Postgres metadata storage. Hive reads the prepared Parquet dataset
through an external table and writes outputs under `outputs/hive/`.

Docker Desktop must be running before starting Hive. The Hive services remain
running after the command finishes; stop them with:

```powershell
make stop-hive
```

Validate the Hive outputs against the Spark SQL reference with:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\validate_hive_outputs.py
```

### Run all local jobs

```bash
make run-all-local
```

---

## Benchmarking

The benchmark runner executes analytical jobs across multiple input sizes and records execution metrics.

Metrics collected include:

```text
technology
job_name
input_size_label
input_records
environment
cluster_size
execution_time_seconds
output_rows
status
timestamp
```

Run local benchmarks:

```bash
make benchmark-local
```

Run cluster benchmarks, if a cluster environment is available:

```bash
make benchmark-cluster
```

Benchmark results are stored in:

```text
experiments/results/local/
experiments/results/cluster/
```

---

## Outputs

Analytical outputs are stored by technology:

```text
outputs/spark_sql/
outputs/spark_core/
outputs/hive/
outputs/mapreduce/
```

Each technology should produce comparable outputs for the same analytical job.

---

## Report

The final report is developed in Markdown and exported as PDF.

Report files are stored in:

```text
report/
```

Expected report outputs:

```text
report/final_report.md
report/final_report.pdf
report/figures/
report/tables/
```

Generate charts:

```bash
make charts
```

Generate final report:

```bash
make report
```

---

## Reproducibility

A complete reproduction should follow this sequence:

```bash
make setup
make inspect-raw
make prepare
make generate-sizes
make benchmark-local
make charts
make report
```

If Hive or cluster execution requires additional setup, see:

```text
docs/reproducibility.md
```

---

## Expected Makefile Commands

The project is expected to expose the following commands:

```text
setup
inspect-raw
prepare
generate-sizes
run-spark-sql
run-spark-core
run-hive
stop-hive
run-all-local
benchmark-local
benchmark-cluster
charts
report
clean
```

---

## Experimental Plan

The project compares execution times across:

- Different technologies
- Different analytical jobs
- Different input sizes
- Local and cluster environments, where available

Suggested local benchmark matrix:

| Input Size | Spark SQL | Spark Core | Hive |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 100k | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| 500k | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| 1M | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| 3M | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| 7M+ | Yes | Yes | Yes |

Suggested cluster benchmark matrix:

| Input Size | Spark SQL | Spark Core | Hive |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1M | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| 3M | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| 7M+ | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| 14M | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| 28M | Yes | Yes | Yes |

---

## Documentation

Additional documentation is stored under:

```text
docs/
```

Recommended documents:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `architecture.md` | System architecture and data flow |
| `data_preparation.md` | Cleaning rules and schema decisions |
| `reproducibility.md` | Full setup and execution instructions |
| `technology_comparison.md` | Notes comparing Spark SQL, Spark Core, Hive, and optional MapReduce |

---

## Git Ignore Policy

The repository should not track large generated artifacts.

Recommended ignored paths:

```text
data/raw/*
data/prepared/*
data/generated/*
outputs/*
experiments/results/*
report/figures/*
report/tables/*
*.parquet
*.csv
*.log
```

Keep `.gitkeep` files where empty directories need to be preserved.

---

## Known Limitations

Current expected limitations:

- The full raw dataset is not stored in the repository.
- Cluster experiments depend on the availability of a suitable execution environment.
- Larger-than-original datasets are generated through controlled replication, so they are intended for scalability testing rather than new statistical insight.
- Hive execution may require additional local or Docker-based configuration.
- MapReduce is treated as an optional extension unless explicitly implemented.

---

## Final Deliverables

The final submission will include:

- Final PDF report
- GitHub repository link
- Source code
- SQL scripts
- Execution scripts
- Benchmark results
- Output samples
- Tables and charts
- Reproducibility documentation
